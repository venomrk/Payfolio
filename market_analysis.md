# Payfolio - Market Analysis & Strategy

## 1. Market Problem
**The Core Issue:** Freelancers and agencies struggle with disjointed payment and portfolio systems.
- **Fragmented Tools:** Creators use one tool for invoices (Stripe/PayPal), another for portfolios (Carrd/Webflow), and another for client communication.
- **Trust Deficit:** Clients are hesitant to pay upfront, and freelancers fear non-payment. Escrow services are expensive and complex.
- **High Fees:** Platforms like Upwork/Fiverr take 20% cuts.

**The Solution:** Payfolio is a "Storefront for Services" that combines a professional portfolio with integrated payments, contracts, and milestone tracking—charging 0% platform fees on the first $1k/mo.

*   **Region:** Global (Stripe supported countries).

### Secondary ICP
